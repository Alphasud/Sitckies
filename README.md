# Sticker Note App
A small web-app which allows users to arrange sticky notes on a canvas.

## Get started
This project uses npm.

Go to directory, then

`npm install`

then, 

`npm run start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## In this app you can :
- Add a sticky note anywhere on the screen.
- Drag and drop a sticky note to a new location.
- Delete a sticky note.
- Set the text contained in a sticky note (either at creation or after).
- Clear the canvas of all sticky notes and background.
- Change the color of a sticky note.
- Draw anywhere on the canvas, select eraser tool to erase, or erase all drawing.
- Paste an image link to set it as the background canvas.
- You can save your canvas on a distant database (here I use Firestore from Firebase)
