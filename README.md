# Sticker Note App
A small web-app which allows users to arrange sticky notes on a canvas.

## Get started
This project uses npm.

Go to directory, then

`npm install`

then, 

`npm run start`

It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## In this app you can :
- Add a sticky note anywhere on the screen.
- Drag and drop a sticky note to a new location.
- Delete a sticky note.
- Set the text contained in a sticky note (either at creation or after).
- Clear the canvas of all sticky notes and background.
- Change the color of a sticky note.
- Draw anywhere on the canvas, switch pen color (default is black), select eraser tool to erase, or erase all drawing at once (for now, drawing cannot be saved)
- Paste an image link to set it as the canvas background.
- Save your canvas on a distant database (here I use Firestore from Firebase).

## Future features could include :
- Authentication.
- 'Private' dashboard with all your canvas and personal info.
- Creating multiple canvas.
- Sharing canvas with other user.
